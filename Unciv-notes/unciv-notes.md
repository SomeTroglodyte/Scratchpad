##UI
* Yes/No boxes and keys Y, N, Enter - i10n?
* Remap Improvement "R" key to railroad once researched
* Mousewheel in mod manager
* F1 key to civilopedia

##Shortcuts
* Buying several tiles in city view (buy next ring)
* Buying buildings faster in city view (buy all affordable? buy queue?)
* Global city construction changes (e.g. all science to gold)

##Debug
* Incompatibility More luxuries mod + 5Hex tileset + experimental tile layering: coral fisheries, barrier reef black

##Try
* ~~Higher resolution option - 1800 looks good on a 2.6k 32" panel, but not much better than 1500. 2400 looks worse.~~

##Civilopedia
* "Link right half" - make it callable to preselect a specific entry
* "Link left half" - system to make partial text selectable
* "Internal Link generation" - criteria? Some extra metadata needed?
* "External links" - e.g. world view bottom right: terrain, resource, improvement, unit?
* System to include extra text for hardcoded stuff:
* * Citadel limitation 'within or next to own borders'
