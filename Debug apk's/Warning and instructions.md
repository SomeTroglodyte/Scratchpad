# Warning
- These are copies of debug builds, same as Android Studio uses to launch debug sessions for AVD's or debug-enabled hardware
- Therefore, their signature does not match those used by any app store and they can neither be installed parallel to nor as upgrade to normal Unciv
- They may depend on debug settings - my boxes are different, I do not know how a run-of the-mill Android may react
- Since they are unsuitable as updates the only way to install them when Unciv is already installed is to normally uninstall Unciv first
- Same applies when you want to switch from a debug build back to store-supplied Unciv
- Uninstall means data loss - settings, saves, maps, mods.
- Do not share links, they will disappear soon enough

## Instructions
- If you want to keep all Unciv data, use your rooted file manager - if you're rooted you should know where to look - and back them up
- If you want to keep a few saved games use the 'custom save location' feature from within Unciv to create backups outside of the app's data
- Uninstall Unciv
- Enable external sources if you haven't already - on earlier Android versions this was a global setting, now it is per app - I'd suggest enabling this for your preferred file manager only.
- Install one of these apks by launching them - if Android asks associate them with the stock package manager
- test

## Known issues
- Unciv-debug-Civilopedia-Flavour-001.apk is missing the updated atlas files -> white square instead of "link" icon
- Unciv-debug-Civilopedia-Flavour-001.apk is quite outdated compared to local branch
